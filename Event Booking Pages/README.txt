I create a webside that i connected with SQLite, Node.js, jQuery, jsRender and jsSerialize and connected with Sqlite database, were the users have to login and then the posibilty to check their reservation were they can delete or add (Modify in case they are Administrator user), opinions and also check the users data if they have the Administrator roll.

# My Node.js Project

This is a simple Node.js project that uses npm to manage dependencies and SQLite as a database. Below are the steps to set up and run the project.

## Installing Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them installed yet, you can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

To check the installation, run the following commands in your terminal:

node -v
npm -v

## Installing Project Dependencies

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root folder:

cd /path/to/project

3. Run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file:

npm install

This will download and install all dependencies into a folder called node_modules in the project directory.

## Installing SQLite as a Dependency

4. Use SQLite for project functionality:

https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

Possibility to view user data and log in.

Now, all that remains is to run a local server and test your project. If you need more information, feel free to get in touch with me.
